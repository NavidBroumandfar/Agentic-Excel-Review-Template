Module: M12-Roadmap-Viz
Purpose: Add a clear roadmap visualization to MTCR_Demo.ipynb.

Changes:
- Kept the existing roadmap DataFrame (Module, Status, Focus).
- Added a Matplotlib horizontal bar chart:
  * Y-axis: modules (M1–M13).
  * Each bar: constant width, color-coded by Status (Done, Prototype, Planned).
  * Legend explains the colors.
- No new dependencies; reused matplotlib already present in the notebook.

Notes:
- This chart is meant to visually reinforce the roadmap table during the demo, not to encode numeric values.
