Module: M13-Agent-Pipeline-Viz
Purpose: Add a simple visual flow for the agentic automation pipeline in MTCR_Demo.ipynb.

Changes:
- Kept the existing agent_pipeline DataFrame (Step, Component, What it does).
- Added a Matplotlib-based horizontal flow diagram:
  * X-axis: step numbers (1–6).
  * Each step drawn as a node on a horizontal line.
  * Labels show the Component names above each node.
- No new dependencies introduced (reuses matplotlib only).

Notes:
- The goal is to provide a quick visual story of the agent pipeline while preserving the detailed table.
